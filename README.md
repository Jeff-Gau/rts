# rts

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rts is to get data from the [Return to School
Project](http://returntoschoolproject.org/) into R in a variety of
forms. It is designed for internal use for the project and not likely
useful outside of the project.

## Installation

You can install the package from R via

``` r
# install.packages("remotes") # if not previously installed
remotes::install_github("datalorax/rts")
```

## Usage

You first need to have an API key for the specific project. You can save
this in your `.REnviron`. This will end up looking something like the
below (note, this is a fake token).

After youâ€™ve completed this, you can download the raw data with the
following code.

``` r
library(rts)
d <- get_rts_data()

nrow(d)
#> [1] 99
ncol(d)
#> [1] 5490
```

This is just the raw data, and not particularly useful, but future
development will have it spit out the data for any survey and in a
variety of different formats.
